The astrophysicist does not fear the dark because we know the night to b ablaze with light our eyes cannot see.

Congratulations to this season’s Graduates. Just remember that graduations are not really the end of anything. Instead, they are the beginning of everything.

Sorry. Didn’t mean to be obscure.  Flea Markets & White Elephant sales are both places where you sell stuff you no longer want. Yet one animal ten billion times the mass of the other. Perhaps I’m the only one to find that amusing.

We cry foul when fooled by fake news and other forces of brainwashing, when perhaps we should instead build intellectual defenses against it, inoculating us from such influences in the first place.

The Qur’an says plainly that daytime fasting during Ramadan ends at “Dark” not at sunset. “Dark” is a good match for the end of twilight. This time of year: up to 15 mins later in equatorial latitudes. 30 mins at middle latitudes. And 45 mins at higher latitudes. I’m just saying.

During Ramadan, daytime fasting for Muslims ends at sunset. But for Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, the Sun sets four minutes later at the top than at the bottom. High-floor dwellers see beyond the ground-level horizon, farther along Earth’s curvature.

If you wield the power to snap your finger and end half of all life in the universe — to preserve resources for those who remain — then you surely have the power to snap your finger and double the resources instead.

@Avengers, I checked the math on that one.

FYI:  An average comet contains as much water as has ever been consumed by all humans who have ever lived.

FYI: A garden-variety metallic asteroid contains vastly more gold than has ever been mined in the history of the world.

Sure, Thanos is singularly evil. But I bet he flunked Astro 101.

He wants to kill half of all living things to save the other half — due to limited resources.

But the universe has vastly more resources than can possibly be consumed by civilizations that have access to space.

Wishing Director John Singleton (age 51) a speedy recovery from his stroke.

An occasion, perhaps, for the rest of us to be amazed that human physiology works at all.

Maybe our educational system isn't that bad. Perhaps flat-Earthers are actually rational space enthusiasts who are duping us to make them the first tourists launched into orbit, granting them a free, space-borne view of the rotating ball that is Earth.

“On Being Round” — Chap. 8 of **Astrophysics for People in A Hurry** discusses how the laws of physics conspire across the cosmos to prefer spheres. If you think Earth is flat you’ve never read this chapter or you have yet to establish a relationship with objective reality.
