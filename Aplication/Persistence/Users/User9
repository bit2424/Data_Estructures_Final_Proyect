Good things come in mini-fridge-sized packages. The Green Propellant Infusion Mission will test a low toxicity propellant in space for the first time. This technology could lengthen mission durations by using less propellant. Go green — in space: https://go.nasa.gov/2QkEkP2
In this photo, a Ball Aerospace engineer performs final checks before the spacecraft shipped to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch processing.
