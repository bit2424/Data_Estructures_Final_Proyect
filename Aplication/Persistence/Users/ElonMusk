Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps & elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot

Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.

Very exciting. Prior to 2019.16.2 my car could not take this exit on its own. 

Further, With AP on the ramp, it would panic and tell me to take over as it couldn’t pic a lane. 

Today the car handled the whole situation! Well done @Tesla and @elonmusk
