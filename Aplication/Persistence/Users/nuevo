One hundred years ago, a total solar eclipse turned an obscure scientist into a household name. You might have heard of him — his name is Albert Einstein. But how did a solar eclipse demonstrate his theory about general relativity? Find out: https://go.nasa.gov/2woG1ld

What does jelly have to do w/ earthquakes? ? Jelly is a colloid — a collection of material dispersed in a fluid. Similar to colloids, the Earth’s crust releases stress through quakes. @ISS_Research can use jelly to predict shelf life of roads & bridges: https://go.nasa.gov/2QuEbbJ
