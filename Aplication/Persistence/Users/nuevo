NBC’s decision to cancel A.P. Bio after two seasons turned out to be anything but a quiet ending for the comedy #SaveAPBio

In the final episode of season 1, the writers fully got Helen & her dynamic w Jack. It’s been a blast to write since this. Thank you ep writers Jeff Vanderkruik & Brian Ashburn. I think the ski ramp joke is the hilarious @luvhrakhe

After we heard the news that #APBio had been cancelled, I felt frozen. So when @pattonoswalt started #SaveAPBio I felt scared to feel upset all over again. Then I saw the outpouring of love and support and I’m reminded this beloved show is worth the fight. #SaveAPBioMary Sohn added,

I’m saying none of you should have to apologize for how you watch it. The people airing the shows need to adjust to you. And some have. But I still see all the articles quote our NightOf numbers. Someone needs to post our dvr/streaming numbers and compare to other canceled shows. …
