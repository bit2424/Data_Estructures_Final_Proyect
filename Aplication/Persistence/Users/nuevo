Today, Justice Thomas wrote: SCOTUS has been zealous in the past in barring discrimination based on sex, race, & disability. Hopeful someday soon SCOTUS will recognize the same protections for the unborn when they rule on future appeals of pro-life legislation.

As Governor of IN I was proud to sign a law that requires remains of aborted babies be treated w/dignity & respect and blocks groups like Planned Parenthood from the horrific practice of selling fetal tissue. Today’s decision by the Supreme Court was a victory for life!

Nearly 1 million Americans have fallen in uniform since the founding of this nation. Americans of every race & creed have fought & died for our freedom. But numbers tell nothing of the lives of promise cut short, dreams unfulfilled,families shattered. Words fail when heroes fall.

There is a day in November when we remember who served & came home – but today is the day when, all across America, in gatherings large and small, we pause to honor and remember those who served our nation and did not come home. It is Memorial Day in America. #MemorialDay

From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood, from San Juan Hill to Saipan, and from the Coral Sea to Kandahar, heroic Americans have answered their nation’s call — and paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Their duty was to serve – our duty is to remember.

Landed in Muncie, IN this morning and was briefed on last night’s shooting. I commend law enforcement for their quick response. My prayers are with the injured and their families. God bless them all.

To the men & women in our Armed Forces: @POTUS understands that our nation’s security depends on each of you – and that the foundation of American military might are the men and women who wear the uniform of our Armed Forces. THANK YOU!

After the last administration depleted our military through constant budget cuts, @POTUS took decisive action to rebuild our military & restore the arsenal of democracy, signing the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan!

Thank you, Eau Claire, Wisconsin! @SenRonJohnson is a great leader & a champion of the #USMCA – but right now, @SenatorBaldwin &  @RepRonKind are on the fence. So I need you to call @RepRonKind & @SenatorBaldwin & tell ‘em you need the #USMCA now!

Great to be at J&D Manufacturing in Eau Claire, Wisconsin! American workers & job creators need Congress to ratify the #USMCA this year. The USMCA will give American businesses like J&D the level playing field they need to compete and WIN!
